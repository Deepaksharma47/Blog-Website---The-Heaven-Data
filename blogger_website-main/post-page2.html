        <h2 class="sub-heading">History</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial
            beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted
            by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of
            symbols.This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine
            based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a
            handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.

        <h2 class="sub-heading"> Technology</h2>
        <p class="post-text">AI-based tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E use complex algorithms to learn from vast amounts of
            data and create new content, making them powerful tools for natural language processing and image
            generation. A point that is interesting to note and somewhat concerning is that many ML models that shape
            how we use the internet today, from YouTube’s video recommendation algorithm to Instagram’s recommendation
            algorithm and even ChatGPT itself, are all what are known as “black box” algorithms. Meaning that the
            engineers that design them cannot accurately pinpoint why or how a certain algorithm arrives at a given
            solution. As these tools are developed with more resources, trained on more data, and generate more complex
            and useful outputs, their influence will grow exponentially across numerous fields. It is important that
            regulators, tech companies, and even the regular internet user are cognizant of the power of these tools and
            can address them in a way that maximizes their useful application while minimizing the massive risk factors
            involved.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">

            Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.
            
            While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.
            
           <br> Advantages -><br>
            
                Good at detail-oriented jobs;
                Reduced time for data-heavy tasks;
                Delivers consistent results; and
                AI-powered virtual agents are always available.
            
            <br>Disadvantages -><br>
            
                Expensive;
                Requires deep technical expertise;
                Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools;
                Only knows what it's been shown; and
                Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Artificial Intelligence Examples</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Artificial intelligence technology takes many forms, from chatbots to navigation apps and wearable fitness trackers. The below examples illustrate the breadth of potential AI applications.
            ChatGPT
            
            ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot capable of producing written content in a range of formats, from essays to code and answers to simple questions. Launched in November 2022 by OpenAI, ChatGPT is powered by a large language model that allows it to closely emulate human writing.
            Google Maps
            
            Google Maps uses location data from smartphones, as well as user-reported data on things like construction and car accidents, to monitor the ebb and flow of traffic and assess what the fastest route will be. 
            Smart Assistants
            
            Personal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana use natural language processing, or NLP, to receive instructions from users to set reminders, search for online information and control the lights in people’s homes. In many cases, these assistants are designed to learn a user’s preferences and improve their experience over time with better suggestions and more tailored responses.
            Snapchat Filters
            
            Snapchat filters use ML algorithms to distinguish between an image’s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing.
